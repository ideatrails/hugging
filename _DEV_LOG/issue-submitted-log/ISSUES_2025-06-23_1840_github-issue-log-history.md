### Issue #2: üéµ Add Faster Whisper Audio Transcription Test
- **Created**: 2025-06-23 ~18:35 (attempted, failed due to CLI issues)
- **URL**: ‚ùå ORIGINAL CREATION FAILED, but concept is the valid one
- **Status**: üîÑ CONCEPT ACTIVE (duplicates #3, #4 closed)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Labels**: enhancement, ml-integration, audio-processing, test-suite

#### Context
Proposed during discussion about extending the ML test suite beyond the current 3/3 working tests (spaCy, transformers sentiment, memory profiling). Goal was to add audio transcription capabilities using Faster Whisper on a desiredata.mp3 file.

#### Issue Description Summary
- Extend ML environment with audio transcription capabilities
- Test Faster Whisper performance on real audio data (desiredata.mp3)
- Add to test suite (targeting 4/4 working tests)
- Document audio processing memory usage patterns
- Test compatibility with existing ML stack

#### Technical Requirements
- Add `faster-whisper` dependency via uv
- Create `whisper-test.py` following established patterns
- Memory profiling integration
- Compatibility testing with spaCy + transformers

#### Creation Failure Analysis
- **Issue**: `gh issue create` command hung/failed during execution
- **Possible Causes**: 
  - Large issue body content
  - Network connectivity issues
  - GitHub API rate limiting
  - Terminal/process management issues

#### Retry Attempts (2025-06-23 18:42)
**Attempt #2**: Simplified content
```bash
gh issue create --title "Add Faster Whisper Audio Transcription Test" --body "Add Faster Whisper testing to ML test suite using desiredata.mp3..."
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Command hung again

**Attempt #3**: Minimal content
```bash
gh issue create --title "Add Faster Whisper Test" --body "Add audio transcription test with faster-whisper on desiredata.mp3"
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Command hung again

**Attempt #4**: Check authentication
```bash
gh auth status
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Command hung - indicates broader gh CLI issue

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue**: All `gh` CLI commands hanging, not just issue creation
- **Possible Causes**:
  - GitHub CLI authentication timeout
  - Network connectivity issues
  - GitHub API service issues
  - Local gh CLI configuration problems

#### Next Steps
- ‚è≥ Try GitHub web interface for issue creation
- üîß Debug gh CLI authentication/connectivity
- ÔøΩ Document manual issue creation process
- üîÑ Update issue log when resolved

#### Expected Implementation
```python
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

def transcribe_audio(audio_path):
    model = WhisperModel('base', device='cpu')
    segments, info = model.transcribe(audio_path)
    
    for segment in segments:
        print(f'[{segment.start:.2f}s -> {segment.end:.2f}s] {segment.text}')

transcribe_audio('desiredata.mp3')
```

#### ‚úÖ RESOLUTION UPDATE (2025-06-23 18:45)
**Attempt #5**: Fresh shell session
```bash
# Started new terminal session
bash
cd /home/angels/repo/py/hugging
gh issue create --title "Add Faster Whisper Test" --body "Add audio transcription test with faster-whisper on desiredata.mp3"
```
**Result**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS!**

- **Issue Created**: https://github.com/ideatrails/hugging/issues/4
- **Title**: "Add Faster Whisper Test"
- **Status**: üîÑ OPEN
- **Resolution Method**: Fresh shell session resolved hanging gh CLI commands

**Root Cause**: Terminal/shell session state causing gh CLI to hang
**Solution**: Starting fresh shell session cleared the problem
**Learning**: Shell session state can affect CLI tool behavior

### Issue #3: üéµ Add Faster Whisper Test
