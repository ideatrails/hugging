## 🏗️ Current Technical State

### ✅ Fully Functional ML Environment
```bash
# All test files working (100% success rate)
uv run spacy-test.py        # ✅ NLP noun phrase extraction
uv run sentiment-test.py    # ✅ 99.95% confidence sentiment analysis
uv run memory-info-test.py  # ✅ Memory profiling (345MB load, 7MB inference)
```

### 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Python**: 3.12 in uv-managed virtual environment
- **Package Manager**: uv (user strongly prefers this over pip/poetry)
- **ML Libraries**: spaCy v3.8.7, transformers, memory-profiler
- **Compatibility**: All version conflicts resolved, stable integration

### 📊 Performance Benchmarks
- **Model Loading**: ~345MB memory usage (transformers)
- **Inference**: ~7MB additional memory per prediction
- **Accuracy**: 99.9%+ confidence on sentiment analysis
- **Processing**: Real-time NLP and sentiment analysis working

## 🎯 Active Development Items

### 📋 GitHub Issues Status
- **Issue #1**: 📝 README documentation (comprehensive version ready for merge)
- **Issue #2**: 🎵 Faster Whisper audio transcription testing
- **Issue #5**: 📝 Create transcript for tran-hits integration
- **Closed**: #3, #4, #6 (duplicates due to gh CLI behavior)

### 🔄 Current Branch State
- **main**: Stable, protected, basic content
- **feature/comprehensive-readme**: Ready for merge, addresses issue #1

## 🚨 Critical Knowledge for AI Agents

### 🛠️ gh CLI Behavior Pattern
**IMPORTANT**: GitHub CLI commands may appear to hang but are actually working!

**Pattern**:
1. Command appears stuck with no output
2. AI agent assumes failure and retries
3. Original command succeeds in background
4. Results in duplicate issues

**Solution**:
- Wait longer before assuming failure (15-30 seconds)
- Check GitHub web interface to verify if actions completed
- Don't retry immediately if command appears stuck

### 🔧 Package Management Patterns
**DO**:
- Use `uv add <package>` for all dependency management
- Install core libraries first, then extensions (e.g., spacy → spacy models)
- Test compatibility after each major addition

**DON'T**:
- Use pip commands in uv environments
- Manually edit pyproject.toml for dependencies
- Assume latest versions are compatible

### 📝 DevLog Documentation Requirements
**MUST**:
- Use real timestamps (get with `date` command)
- Document failures honestly, not just successes
- Explain rationale for decisions made
- Update handoff documents for session continuity

## 🎯 Recommended Next Actions

### Option A: Complete README Merge (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
```bash
# The comprehensive README is ready on feature branch
git checkout feature/comprehensive-readme
git status  # Verify clean state
# Create PR to merge comprehensive README
gh pr create --title "Complete Meta-Project README Documentation" --body "Addresses issue #1 with comprehensive documentation of meta-project nature, technical stack, and real problem-solving examples"
```

### Option B: Implement Audio Transcription (Issue #2)
```bash
# Add Faster Whisper for audio processing
uv add faster-whisper
# Create whisper-test.py following established patterns
# Test on desiredata.mp3 (if available)
# Document memory usage and compatibility
```

### Option C: Transcript for tran-hits (Issue #5)
```bash
# Research tran-hits format requirements
# Generate compatible transcript file
# Test integration workflow
# Document format specifications
```

## 🧠 User Context & Preferences
